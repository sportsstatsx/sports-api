  <h1>Privacy Policy (ENG)</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last Updated: November 2025</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p>
      <strong>SportsStatsX</strong> (the “App”) respects your privacy and complies with applicable laws and
      Google Play policies. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it,
      how long we keep it, and your rights.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The App minimizes data collection. The App does <strong>not require account registration</strong> and does
    not collect directly identifying personal information such as your name or email for normal use.
    We may use a <strong>device identifier</strong> to distinguish users and to verify premium entitlement
    <strong>without login</strong>. If you enable push notifications, we use a push token to deliver alerts you request.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Device Identifier (Android ID)</strong>:
      used to distinguish devices/users, prevent abuse, and (if applicable) verify premium entitlement without login.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Push Notification Token (e.g., FCM token)</strong>:
      used only when you enable push notifications, to deliver match alerts and service messages you opted into.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Technical Diagnostics</strong>:
      OS/app version, device model, screen metrics (e.g., resolution), timestamps/basic logs, and network state
      for stability, troubleshooting, and improving reliability.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Purchase Metadata (Premium Entitlement Verification)</strong>:
      Google Play purchase token, product ID (SKU), and transaction time,
      used only to verify premium access and prevent entitlement fraud.
      <em>The App does not collect payment card or bank account details.</em>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="muted">
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect sensitive data such as precise location, contacts, phone number, SMS,
    IMEI, or MAC address.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate core features (data delivery, settings storage, feature access control)</li>
    <li>Deliver optional push notifications when you have enabled them</li>
    <li>Prevent abuse, protect service integrity, and comply with platform policies</li>
    <li>Diagnose crashes/issues and improve performance and reliability</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No sale of data</strong>: We do not sell, rent, or trade user data.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Service providers</strong>: We may share limited data with providers strictly to operate core functions
      (e.g., push delivery, hosting, or diagnostics), under confidentiality and security obligations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legal requirements</strong>: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights,
      safety, and service integrity.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Storage and Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Data may be stored locally on your device and, if necessary, on secure servers for providing the service.
    </li>
    <li>
      Diagnostic data may be deleted immediately or retained up to <strong>30 days</strong> for troubleshooting, then removed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Purchase metadata is retained only as required by law or as needed to verify premium entitlement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Uninstalling the App removes locally stored data. Server-side records (if any) may remain until the purpose is fulfilled
      or until deletion under this policy.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    No system can guarantee absolute security, but we implement and improve technical and organizational safeguards.
    Internal access is restricted on a need-to-know basis. Where appropriate, identifiers may be hashed or encrypted.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: You can enable/disable push notifications in the App settings and/or device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Uninstall</strong>: You can uninstall the App at any time to remove locally stored data.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Purchases</strong>: Subscription management, renewal, and refunds are handled through Google Play policies and support.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Contact</strong>: You can request help or ask privacy questions via the contact below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under the minimum age required by local law to use apps without parental consent.
    If local law does not permit you to use the App, you should not use it.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page.
    Continued use of the App after changes become effective indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
