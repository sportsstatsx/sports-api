<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Last Updated: November 2025</p>

<div class="box">
  <p>
    <strong>SportsStatsX</strong> (the “App”) values your privacy and complies with applicable laws
    and Google Play policies. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect,
    how we use it, how long we retain it, and your rights.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. Summary</h2>
<p>
  We minimize data collection. The App does <strong>not require registration</strong> and does not
  collect directly identifiable personal information such as names or email addresses.
  A <strong>device identifier</strong> may be used to distinguish users and verify premium entitlements
  without login.
</p>

<h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Device Identifier (Android ID)</strong> – used to distinguish users,
    verify premium access, and prevent abuse.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Push Notification Token (e.g., FCM Token)</strong> – used only to deliver
    optional notifications such as match alerts or service messages,
    when you have enabled notifications.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Technical Diagnostics</strong> – OS version, app version, device model,
    screen metrics, basic logs (date/time), and network state for stability
    and troubleshooting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Purchase Metadata</strong> – Google Play purchase token, product ID (SKU),
    and transaction time, used solely to verify premium access.
    <em>The App does not collect payment card or bank account information.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
  We do not collect sensitive data such as precise location, contacts,
  phone numbers, SMS, IMEI, or MAC addresses.
</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide and operate the App and its features</li>
  <li>Verify premium entitlements and prevent fraud or abuse</li>
  <li>Deliver optional notifications when permitted by the user</li>
  <li>Maintain stability, troubleshoot issues, and improve service quality</li>
  <li>Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Storage and Retention</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data may be stored locally on your device and, if necessary, on secure servers</li>
  <li>Technical diagnostic data may be deleted immediately or within 30 days</li>
  <li>Purchase metadata is retained only as required by law or for entitlement verification</li>
  <li>Uninstalling the App removes locally stored data</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do not sell, rent, or trade user data</li>
  <li>
    Data may be shared with service providers solely to operate core functions
    (e.g., push notifications or crash reporting), under confidentiality obligations
  </li>
  <li>
    Information may be disclosed when required by law or to protect legal rights
    and service integrity
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>
  While no system can guarantee absolute security, we implement and continuously improve
  technical and organizational safeguards. Identifiers may be hashed or encrypted,
  and internal access is limited to operational necessity.
</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You may uninstall the App at any time to delete locally stored data</li>
  <li>Purchases, subscriptions, renewals, and refunds are handled by Google Play</li>
  <li>You may contact us for questions or lawful requests</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Children</h2>
<p>
  The App is not directed to children under the minimum age required by applicable law
  to use apps without parental consent. Do not use the App if your local law does not permit it.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
  Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
